# U.S. 2019 CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions Reduction from Natural Gas?

The article titled “Biden & Democrats conceal U.S. CO2 decreases of 3.4 billion tons from natural gas”, written by Larry Hamlin, is intended to persuade its primary audience of the American general public that the Democratic Party’s climate change goals hurt Americans and that natural gas is the best source for the U.S.’s future energy production (Hamlin, 2021).
Its main source of information is from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which released a report in September 2020 showing that U.S. carbon dioxide emissions were reduced by 2.8% in 2019 compared to the previous year (Hamlin, 2021; U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), 2020).
The article then goes on to attribute this emissions reduction primarily to a switch from coal to natural gas, while implying that the U.S. does not need to drastically reduce carbon emissions and is much better in comparison to developing countries such as China and India (Hamlin, 2021).
In addition, renewable energy sources (particularly solar and wind), were not credited with reducing overall carbon dioxide emissions and were attributed to causing grid unreliability and blackouts (Hamlin, 2021).
Although none of the numerical facts or graphs presented are incorrect, the way in which they are used is a fallacy of relative privation—"because natural gas is less bad than oil, it must be the best option”.

The article’s attribution of the decrease in carbon dioxide emissions to increased use of natural gas is not showing the complete picture (Hamlin, 2021).
Its own primary source acknowledges that while a switch from coal to natural gas led to a decrease of 525 MMmt of CO2 emissions in 2019, non-carbon-related energy sources contributed to a further 330 MMmt CO2 emissions reduction, a significant amount (U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), 2020).
In addition, due to natural gas having the lowest emissions compared to other fossil fuels, it has been seen as a short- and medium-term transition fuel to eventual net-zero carbon energy sources (Pachauri et al., 2015; Safari et al., 2019; Gürsan and de Gooyert, 2021).
However, the eventual goal is to transition completely to low and zero emissions energy sources, which the article fails to communicate when recommending natural gas. 

Furthermore, the article’s claims that the U.S. is not a major contributor to global climate change, especially in comparison to China and India, can be well-disputed.
In 2018, the U.S. was the second largest contributor to global carbon dioxide emissions (15%), at roughly half of China’s emissions (28%), while India contributed about half of the U.S.’s total emissions (7%) (Friedlingstein et al., 2019).
However, per capita carbon dioxide emissions in 2018 were highest for the U.S. at 4.5 tC/person compared to 1.9 tC/person for China, only 0.5 tC/person for India, and a global average of 1.3 tC/person (Friedlingstein et al., 2019).
This points to a 2.8% decrease in emissions from 2018 to 2019 in the U.S. being far from enough to be equitable or sustainable.

While turning to natural gas may be an interim solution to the high carbon dioxide emissions from coal, it is not the completely “clean” source that the article touts it as.
Emitting approximately 53.4 kg of CO2 per every thousand cubic feet of natural gas from combustion alone (Heede and Oreskes, 2016), there are more climate change-conscious options available.
In conclusion, although the article does not include incorrect information, its selection of facts presents a biased and short-sighted view on U.S. emissions goals and potentially harmfully promotes a short-term solution as a long-term fix to the American public.
